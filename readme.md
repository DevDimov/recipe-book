# Recipe App with React, Node, MongoDB and AWS

A minimalist recipe app for storing one's favourite recipes in one place. It uses React on the front-end, and Node.js on the back-end. It stores recipe information in a MongoDB database and recipe images in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Demo

Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with CodePipeline, and available here: http://recipebook-env.eba-74rvuhh4.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
