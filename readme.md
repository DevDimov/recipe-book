# Recipe App with React, Node, MongoDB and AWS

A minimalist app providing storage and easy access to one's favourite recipes in one place.

It uses React on the front-end, and Node.js on the back-end. It stores recipe information in a MongoDB database and recipe images in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Demo

Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and available here: https://vd-weatherapp.herokuapp.com/
