# Recipe App with React, Node, MongoDB and AWS

A minimalist recipe app for storing one's favourite recipes in one place. It uses React on the front-end, and Node.js on the back-end. It stores recipe information in a MongoDB database and recipe images in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Demo

Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with CodePipeline. To view and interact with the app via a web browser, please contact me.
